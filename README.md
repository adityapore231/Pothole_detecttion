# Pothole detection and counting using yolov8

Using the YOLOv8 algorithm, we trained a model on a dataset of 850 custom pothole images, enabling us to accurately identify and track these road hazards from above. 📸✨ This approach offers significant advantages over traditional ground-based methods, as it allows for comprehensive coverage and faster detection of potholes.
Potholes pose a significant risk to both drivers and pedestrians, leading to vehicle damage, accidents, and even injuries. By implementing an aerial approach to pothole detection, we can proactively identify and address these issues, improving overall road safety and maintenance. 🚧🔧
Our system leverages the agility and maneuverability of aerial vehicles, such as drones to capture high-resolution images of road surfaces. These images are then processed by our trained YOLOv8 model, which accurately identifies and precisely locates potholes. 📡🕵️‍♀️
This project has the potential to revolutionize how we approach pothole detection and repair. By streamlining the identification process, authorities and maintenance teams can promptly prioritize and address potholes, ensuring safer roads and smoother journeys for everyone. 🚀🛠️
I would like to express my gratitude to my team Anushka Patil and Anushka Kadam for their dedication and hard work throughout this project.
I'm eager to continue exploring the possibilities of aerial technology in infrastructure maintenance and safety. If you're interested in learning more about this project or discussing potential collaborations, feel free to reach out. 🌟🚗💪
